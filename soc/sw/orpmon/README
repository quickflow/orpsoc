ORPmon Documentation



INTRODUCTION

  ORPmon is user friendly open source TFTP loader program with a lot of
useful utilities and extra functions -- e.g. memory dump, flash loading,
crc calculation...

  Its small size and scallability makes it useful and fast to load in most
applications. ORPmon is accessible using serial port or VGA terminal.
In former case it should be connected to some tty device.

  Although it is primary use for program loading and executing, it can
also be used for board/device testing.  Numerous tests are already included,
while custom can be easily added.

  When ORPmon displays prompt, e.g. 'orpmon>', it is waiting for input.
Valid command should be entered.  For more information about commands
type 'help' in the ORPmon command prompt.



TODO
 - (uc)Linux command line support
